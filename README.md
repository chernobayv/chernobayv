## 🚀 Key Engineering Projects

### Physical AI & Affective Computing 
* **VitalGroove (NVIDIA Jetson Nano):** Developed a system using MediaPipe Pose Estimation to trigger mechatronic feedback via custom serial handshakes between Python and C++.
* **VLM Optimization:** Optimized Vision-Language Models to run efficiently within constrained 4GB RAM embedded environments.

### Robotics Leadership
* **FRC Team 9262 Founder:** Established a team of 100+ students, secured $60k in hardware sponsorships, and architected a 120lb competition robot with PID-controlled motor systems.
* **Industrial Prototypes:** Integrating DeepSeek LLMs with Raspberry Pi hardware to bridge cloud logic with physical manufacturing.

## ❄️ Beyond the Lab
When I'm not optimizing vision models, I'm training to compete in **figure skating**. I believe the discipline required for competitive athletics directly informs my approach to engineering.
