### Computer Engineering @ Toronto Metropolitan University 
**Physical AI Lab Intern at SAP | FRC Founder | Figure Skater**

I am a Computer Engineering student focused on the intersection of **Physical AI**, high-performance embedded systems, and robotics. My work ranges from architecting industrial VLM prototypes to leading large-scale engineering teams.

## ❄️ Beyond the Lab
When I'm not optimizing vision models, I'm training to compete in **figure skating**. I believe the discipline required for competitive athletics directly informs my approach to engineering.
